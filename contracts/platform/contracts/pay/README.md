# Pay

The goal of the Immutable Pay smart contracts is to make processing on-chain sales faster, simpler and more flexible. Specifically, it aims to allow individual vendors to integrate with a simple API which lets them:

- receive any currency to pay for assets
- choose the currency in which their assets will be priced
- retrieve structured receipts for successful purchases
